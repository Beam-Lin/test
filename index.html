      <strong>Google <sup>LLC</sup></strong> is an American multinational
      technology company focusing on artificial intelligence, online
      advertising, search engine technology, cloud computing, computer software,
      quantum computing, e-commerce, and consumer electronics. It has been
      referred to as "the most powerful company in the world" and as one of the
      world's most valuable brands due to its market dominance, data collection,
      and technological advantages in the field of artificial intelligence.
      Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. is one of the five Big Tech
      companies, alongside Amazon, Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, and Microsoft.
      Google was founded on <i>September 4, 1998</i>, by computer scientists
      Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were PhD students at Stanford
      University in California. Together they own about 14% of its publicly
      listed shares and control 56% of its stockholder voting power through
      super-voting stock. The company went public via an initial public offering
      (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned
      subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is
      a holding company for Alphabet's internet properties and interests. Sundar
      Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on <i>October 24, 2015</i>, replacing
      Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On <i>December 3, 2019</i>,
      Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.

      Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and
      Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford University in
      California. The project initially involved an unofficial "third founder",
      Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for
      the original Google Search engine, but he left before Google was
      officially founded as a company; Hassan went on to pursue a career in
      robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006. While conventional
      search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms
      appeared on the page, they theorized about a better system that analyzed
      the relationships among websites. They called this algorithm PageRank; it
      determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the
      importance of those pages that linked back to the original site. Page told
      his ideas to Hassan, who began writing the code to implement Page's ideas.
      Page and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine "BackRub",
      because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site.
      Hassan as well as Alan Steremberg were cited by Page and Brin as being
      critical to the development of Google. Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd
      later co-authored with Page and Brin the first paper about the project,
      describing PageRank and the initial prototype of the Google search engine,
      published in 1998. Héctor García-Molina and Jeff Ullman were also cited as
      contributors to the project. PageRank was influenced by a similar
      page-ranking and site-scoring algorithm earlier used for RankDex,
      developed by Robin Li in 1996, with Larry Page's PageRank patent including
      a citation to Li's earlier RankDex patent; Li later went on to create the
      Chinese search engine Baidu. Eventually, they changed the name to Google;
      the name of the search engine was a misspelling of the word googol, a very
      large number written 10100 (1 followed by 100 zeros), picked to signify
      that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of
      information. Google's homepage in 1998 Google's original homepage had a
      simple design because the company founders had little experience in HTML,
      the markup language used for designing web pages. Google was initially
      funded by an August 1998 investment of $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim,
      co-founder of Sun Microsystems. This initial investment served as a
      motivation to incorporate the company to be able to use the funds. Page
      and Brin initially approached David Cheriton for advice because he had a
      nearby office in Stanford, and they knew he had startup experience, having
      recently sold the company he co-founded, Granite Systems, to Cisco for
      $220 million. David arranged a meeting with Page and Brin and his Granite
      co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim. The meeting was set for 8 a.m. at the front
      porch of David's home in Palo Alto and it had to be brief because Andy had
      another meeting at Cisco, where he now worked after the acquisition, at 9
      a.m. Andy briefly tested a demo of the website, liked what he saw, and
      then went back to his car to grab the check. David Cheriton later also
      joined in with a $250,000 investment. Google received money from two other
      angel investors in 1998: Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, and entrepreneur
      Ram Shriram. Page and Brin had first approached Shriram, who was a venture
      capitalist, for funding and counsel, and Shriram invested $250,000 in
      Google in February 1998. Shriram knew Bezos because Amazon had acquired
      Junglee, at which Shriram was the president. It was Shriram who told Bezos
      about Google. Bezos asked Shriram to meet Google's founders and they met
      six months after Shriram had made his investment when Bezos and his wife
      were on a vacation trip to the Bay Area. Google's initial funding round
      had already formally closed but Bezos' status as CEO of Amazon was enough
      to persuade Page and Brin to extend the round and accept his investment.
      Between these initial investors, friends, and family Google raised around
      $1,000,000, which is what allowed them to open up their original shop in
      Menlo Park, California. Craig Silverstein, a fellow PhD student at
      Stanford, was hired as the first employee. After some additional, small
      investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999, a new $25 million round
      of funding was announced on June 7, 1999, with major investors including
      the venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital. Both firms
      were initially reticent about investing jointly in Google, as each wanted
      to retain a larger percentage of control over the company to themselves.
      Larry and Sergey however insisted in taking investments from both. Both
      venture companies finally agreed to investing jointly $12.5 million each
      due to their belief in Google's great potential and through the mediation
      of earlier angel investors Ron Conway and Ram Shriram who had contacts in
      the venture companies.

      In March 1999, the company moved its offices to Palo Alto, California,
      which is home to several prominent Silicon Valley technology start-ups.
      The next year, Google began selling advertisements associated with search
      keywords against Page and Brin's initial opposition toward an
      advertising-funded search engine. To maintain an uncluttered page design,
      advertisements were solely text-based. In June 2000, it was announced that
      Google would become the default search engine provider for Yahoo!, one of
      the most popular websites at the time, replacing Inktomi. Google's first
      servers, showing lots of exposed wiring and circuit boards Google's first
      production server In 2003, after outgrowing two other locations, the
      company leased an office complex from Silicon Graphics, at 1600
      Amphitheatre Parkway in Mountain View, California. The complex became
      known as the Googleplex, a play on the word googolplex, the number one
      followed by a googol of zeroes. Three years later, Google bought the
      property from SGI for $319 million. By that time, the name "Google" had
      found its way into everyday language, causing the verb "google" to be
      added to the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English
      Dictionary, denoted as: "to use the Google search engine to obtain
      information on the Internet". The first use of the verb on television
      appeared in an October 2002 episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
      Additionally, in 2001 Google's investors felt the need to have a strong
      internal management, and they agreed to hire Eric Schmidt as the chairman
      and CEO of Google. Eric was proposed by John Doerr from Kleiner Perkins.
      He had been trying to find a CEO that Sergey and Larry would accept for
      several months, but they rejected several candidates because they wanted
      to retain control over the company. Michael Moritz from Sequoia Capital at
      one point even menaced requesting Google to immediately pay back Sequoia's
      $12.5m investment if they did not fulfill their promise to hire a chief
      executive officer, which had been made verbally during investment
      negotiations. Eric was not initially enthusiastic about joining Google
      either, as the company's full potential had not yet been widely recognized
      at the time, and as he was occupied with his responsibilities at Novell
      where he was CEO. As part of him joining, Eric agreed to buy $1 million of
      Google preferred stocks as a way to show his commitment and to provide
      funds Google needed.

      Hi

     <strong>Kakarot</strong> 
Goku (孫そん悟ご空くう Son Gokū, Japanese pronunciation: [sõŋgokɯː]), born Kakarot (カカロット Kakarotto, Japanese pronunciation: [kakaɾot̚to]), is a Saiyan raised on Earth and the main protagonist of the Dragon Ball series. He is the second child and youngest son of Bardock and Gine, the husband of Chi-Chi, and the father of Gohan and Goten. Originally sent to Earth by his parents as an infant, Kakarot was adopted by Grandpa Gohan and renamed Son Goku. A head injury at an early age altered Goku's memory, ridding him of his initial destructive nature and allowing him to grow up to become one of Earth's greatest defenders. Goku constantly strives and trains to be the greatest warrior possible, which has kept the Earth and the universe safe from destruction multiple times.
